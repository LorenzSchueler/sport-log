Sport Log consists of an app written in 🐦 Flutter together with a server backend written in 🦀 Rust.
Additionally, there are action providers which can perform scheduled actions like importing or exporting data from other sources or providing automated reservations on other platforms.
The client and action providers communicate with the server via a REST API.
The client has an own database in order to allow offline use. It synchronizes with the server when connectivity is available.
