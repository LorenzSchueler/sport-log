**Run on real Android device**

1. enable Developer Options on your Android phone (Settings &#8594; About phone &#8594; tap Build number 7 times)
2. enable USB debugging (Settings &#8594; System &#8594; Developer options)
3. connect your phone with your computer via USB
4. set `SERVER_ADDRESS=<address:port>` with the IP address of your machine (where the server is running on; must be in same Wifi network as your phone)

adb pull /data/user/0/org.sport_log.sport_log_client/databases/database.sqlite <folder> # pull file to local storage
```

## Client Server Synchronization

refer to [synchronization](SYNCHRONIZATION.md)
